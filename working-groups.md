# Working Groups

This is a _structured_ list of *all active working groups* in the hackathon. The purpose of this document is to enumerate the reproducible tasks that are being completed or have been completed.  This will serve both as an audit list for the [reproducibility](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/reproducibility) working group, and as a record of accomplishments.


Every entry should have a consistent format.  The record should include:
 - A level-1 heading for the working group
 - A level-2 heading for each task
 - The name of the hackathon participant who is "lead" for that task
 - a level-3 heading for task Inputs 
   - a bullet list of all static input files, *linked* to the location of the input files on the Web if they exist
   - non-static inputs should be listed and described and linked if possible
   - configuration inputs, such as API keys, should be identified but not replicated
 - a level-3 heading for task Outputs
   - a bullet list of all generated outputs, *linked* to the generated outputs within the github repo

And that's it! Good luck!
