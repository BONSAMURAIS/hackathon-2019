[BONSAI](https://bonsai.uno/) is an organization devoted to conceptualizing, organizing, and building a open infrastructure for life cycle inventory data, including an open database, open and transparent data management workflows, and an open and welcoming environment. We will be hosting a hackathon in Barcelona from March 25-29 to develop the first stage in this project; here is a [preliminary agenda, including the focus areas and objectives](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/bonsai/blob/master/hackathon-2019-agenda.md).

We have reserved multiple spots for outside participants, and we invite students or all others interested in developing open life cycle assessment data and workflows to apply. Though we can't offer direct compensation, participants will have their expenses (including travel costs) paid for. We will also have remote participants, so travel is not required.

To apply to join us in Barcelona, or to work during the hackathon remotely, [please fill out the following form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZPRSCMMhtFT8VfKsnjarC0RxIDAWS78ri7rcNuIT-hETDGA/viewform?usp=sf_link).
