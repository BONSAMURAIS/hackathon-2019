# Travel

Onsite participants should plan to arrive on Sunday and leave on Friday evening. Travel by train is preferred where possible, though flying can (unfortunately) be significantly cheaper and quicker.

# Accomodation

Onsite participants will be housed in hotels or group apartments, as they prefer.
